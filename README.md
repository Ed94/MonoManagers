# Abstract Realm
Work In Progress: An engine skeleton.

(What do you mean by skeleton?) This will be a set of modular structures organized as an engine.
The code needs to be tied together in a game as the user sees fit. This just has a great amount of the managament strutures and other things done off the bat when wanting to make a game similar to the one this was intended for. You need to configure this into a proper project and compile from there.

Orginally done in C# with the monogame framework along with bepu physics, I'm now doing it in C++ with SDL, and Boost so far with some basic OpenGL. (Still in the process of porting what was done in c#). I will eventually add a physics engine/framework and 3d renderer (undecided on which).

These include things related to Camera, Display, Input, Interface, State, and Asset management.
