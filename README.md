# Abstract Realm
Work In Progress: An engine skeleton for a 2D game with 3D mechanics.

(What do you mean by skeleton?)
The code needs to be tied together in a game as the user sees fit. This just has a great amount of the managament strutures and other things done off the bat when wanting to make a game similar to the one this was intended for. 

Orginally done in C# with the monogame framework along with bepu physics, I'm now doing it in c++ with sdl, and boost so far with some basic openGL. (Still in the process of porting what was done in c#).

This will be a set of modular structures organized as an engine.

These include things related to Camera, Display, Input, Interface, State, and Asset management as some of the various structures that will be up on this repo.
