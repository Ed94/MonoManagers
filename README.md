Work In Progress: An engine skeleton for a 2D game with 3D mechanics.

(What do you mean by skeleton?)
The code needs to be tied together in a game as the user sees fit. This just has a great amount of the managament strutures and other things done off the bat when wanting to make a game similar to the one this was intended for. Eventually I plan to make this into a extension for monogame.

I'm currently working on  game as both a long term hobby with buissness prospects and to learn C#. I'm using monogame to aid in the process and it has been great. 

This will be a set of modular structures organized as an engine, that can be used with any monogame project, they will be directly influenced by the various classes I have in the game to help mitigate the low level nature of monogame.

These include things related to Camera, Display, Input, Interface, State, and Asset management as some of the various structures that will be up on this repo.
