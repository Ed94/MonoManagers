# MonoManagers
Work In Progress: A set of structures that can be used in any monogame project.

I'm currently working on  game as both a long term hobby with buissness prospects and to learn C#. I'm using monogame to aid in the process and it has been great. 

This will be a set of modular structures that can be used with any monogame project, they will be directly influenced by the various classes I have in the game to help mitigate the low level nature of monogame.

These include things related to Camera, Display, Input, State, and Resource management as some of the various structures that will be up on this repo.
